###Show code
There are many different ways to style code with Github's markdown. 
If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: 'var example=true'. 
If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces :

  if(isAwesome){
    return true
  }
 
GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if(isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
